Workflow will remain same as we go ahed in project such as data ingestion, model training etc.

1. Update config.yaml
2. Update secrets.yaml [Optional]
3. Update params.yaml
4. Update the entity
5. Update the configuration manager in src config
6. Update the components
7. Update the pipeline
8. Update the main.py
9. Update the dvc.yaml

first step is to create notebook in research folder then convert that into modular code

IMP: Considering vgg16 architecture model for base model ()

vgg16 pre-trained on imagenet dataset
It has 2 parts convolution layer(CNN) and FC layer(Fully connected layer) ANN  
It has total 16 layers
We'll create custom FC layer as it has 3 FC dense layer(contains many neurons) 
we will use softmax activation function to separate two class

Let's download base model from keras

Last Part:

create dvc.yaml file 

commnads: dvc init in vs code terminal
devc repro:  it will run dvc.yaml file
dvc dag : graph of pipeline
